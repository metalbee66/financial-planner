# Family Planner — Handover Notes

> **State as of 2026-05-02:** v1.0.0 (Financial Planner) was renamed to **Family Planner** and restructured as a **modular monolith**. Phases 0, 1 and Task 2.1 of v2.0.0 are complete (rebrand + ES modules + module shell + Projects CRUD with participants + task entity within a project). A Playwright E2E harness was added alongside Task 2.1 — 18 tests cover Phase 1 + 2.1 acceptance criteria. Phase 1 has not been merged to master yet (real-Firebase + two-user smoke unverified). Phases 2.2–8 build out the rest of the Projects module — see [tasks/plan.md](../tasks/plan.md).

---

## Architecture

**Stack:** Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, native ES modules, no build tools, no Node.js required.

**Hosting:** GitHub Pages (static) + Firebase Realtime Database (auth + data sync).

**Repo:** https://github.com/metalbee66/financial-planner (public; renaming this would break the GitHub Pages URL — deferred decision, see [tasks/user-actions.md](../tasks/user-actions.md))

**Live:** https://metalbee66.github.io/financial-planner/

**Deploy:** push to `master` → GitHub Pages rebuilds in ~30 seconds. There is no build step.

**Plan & status docs:**
- [tasks/plan.md](../tasks/plan.md) — full v2.0.0 implementation plan, 8 phases, ~25 tasks
- [tasks/todo.md](../tasks/todo.md) — flat checklist with done/pending state
- [tasks/user-actions.md](../tasks/user-actions.md) — manual ops Brad needs to do (n8n setup, Firebase rules, etc.)

## Module Architecture

A **module** is a self-contained sub-app that the shell mounts into a slot under the top-level nav.

### Adding a new module

1. Create `app/js/modules/<id>/index.js` exposing `export function mount(host) { ... }`. The host is a fresh `<div class="module-content">` you can fill via `host.innerHTML = TEMPLATE`.
2. Add an entry to `app/js/modules.js`:
   ```js
   import { mount as mountX } from './modules/x/index.js';
   // ... append to MODULES array:
   { id: 'x', label: 'X', mount: mountX, dataKeys: ['x_data'] }
   ```
3. The shell's top-nav, mounting, and visibility-toggle logic picks up the new entry automatically.

### Module lifecycle

- `mount(host)` is called **once** on app boot for each module.
- Switching top-nav buttons toggles `display: none/''` — no remount, so event handlers persist.
- Within a module, sub-nav and rendering are the module's own responsibility.

### Cross-module shared state

`app/js/state.js` exports a single `state` object. Every module imports it and reads/writes properties:
```js
import { state } from '../../state.js';
state.budgetCY = loadBudgetCY();
```
This replaced the pre-Phase-0 cross-file globals. ES module bindings are read-only, so the property-on-shared-object pattern is what gives us mutability across modules.

### Render hooks (for Firebase realtime sync)

`firebase-sync.js`'s realtime listeners need to call back into UI code without a hard import cycle. The shell registers callbacks at module-load time via `registerRenderHooks({ renderBudgetTab, renderAccountsTab, renderPMTab, renderProjectsTab })`. When another user changes data, the listener fires the appropriate hook.

---

## Key Design Decisions

### Data model (Finance module)
- All amounts stored as **weekly** base rates internally
- Conversion to monthly/quarterly/annual is computed on display
- **Revisions** are date-based overrides on any item:
  - `item.revisions = [{ fromDate, weekly, reason }]`
  - `getEffectiveWeekly(item, date)` returns the correct rate for a given date
- **contributionItems** is an array (auto-migrated from old flat object)
- **weekActuals** stores per-week confirmed/adjusted values with comments

### Persistence
- Save functions in `data.js` always call `fbSave(key, data)`
- `fbSave` writes `localStorage` and conditionally pushes to Firebase based on `useFirebase && currentUser`
- The pre-Phase-0 `patchSaveFunctions()` swap-after-sign-in trick was removed; ES module bindings are read-only

### Firebase
- Config in `firebase-config.js` (API key is safe to be public)
- Database URL: `https://financial-planner-e85d4-default-rtdb.asia-southeast1.firebasedatabase.app` (still has the `financial-planner` slug — see [user-actions.md](../tasks/user-actions.md) D1 for the deferred rename decision)
- Auth: Google Sign-In, restricted to `metalbee66@gmail.com` and `dianaleshcheva@gmail.com`
- Data path: `household/family/{key}`
- Falls back to localStorage if Firebase is unavailable

### Currency formatting (in `data.js`)
- `fmt(n)` → `$1,234.56` or `$-` (NBSP-padded for monospace alignment)
- `fmtPlain(n)` → `$1,234.56` for inputs (no padding)
- `fmtSigned(n)` → ` $1,234.56` or `-$1,234.56`
- `parseCurrency(str)` → number

### Payment scheduling
- `calcPaymentSchedule(item, weekDates)` returns a 52-week array
- Respects revisions: uses `getEffectiveWeekly(item, paymentDate)` per payment
- Mid-week revisions snap to the containing week's Monday

### Data model (Projects module)
- Single Firebase RTDB key `projects` under `household/family/`, holding `{ items: [...projects], tasks: [...tasks] }`. Phase 6 will add `prefs` and `notifications` siblings under the same root — the current single-blob shape is fine because each module's realtime listener only fires once per save and the per-event-kind splits aren't useful until then.
- A project: `{ id, name, status, startDate, endDate, participants[], description, createdAt, updatedAt, archivedAt }`. Status enum: `planning|active|on-hold|completed|cancelled`. IDs are `p_<base36-time>_<6 random base36>`.
- A task: `{ id, projectId, name, description, status, assignee, startDate, dueDate, priority, parentTaskId, dependsOn[], comments[], events[], attachments[], createdAt, updatedAt, completedAt }`. Status enum: `not-started|in-progress|review|done|blocked`. Priority enum: `low|normal|high`. IDs are `t_<base36-time>_<6 random base36>`. Tasks live as a **flat array** keyed by `projectId` rather than nested under each project — this keeps cross-project aggregate views (Phase 5) trivial.
- `updateTaskInList` auto-stamps `completedAt` on the not-done → done transition and clears it on the reverse. The UI relies on this for sorting and the "Done" strikethrough.
- All list mutators in `app/js/modules/projects/data.js` are immutable (return new arrays). UI calls `setProjects(items)` / `setTasks(tasks)` / `setBoth(items, tasks)` (single-save batched). Each writes via `saveProjects` → `fbSave('projects', ...)`. Cascade delete (project → its tasks) goes through `setBoth` so it's one atomic save and one toast.
- `sanitiseProject(p)` and `sanitiseTask(t)` backfill missing fields when older shapes load — no migration script needed for v1's single-version schema. Tasks default to `tasks: []` when older payloads (pre-2.1) load.
- Participants in v1 are constrained to `brad` and `diana` plus free-text strings. There is no per-user record; participant IDs are bare strings. Task `assignee` follows the same convention but can also be `null` (Unassigned).

### View structure (Projects module)
- The module's `index.js` renders one of three modes into its host element: **`list`** (project cards grid), **`detail`** (one project + its tasks), or **`form`** (create/edit project). `mode` is a small object held in the module — there is no router.
- The **task slide-in panel** (`#task-panel`) lives in `document.body` rather than the module host, so it can overlay any view. CSS transform animates it in from the right; backdrop click / Esc / Cancel close without saving. When a task panel is open and the underlying view re-renders (e.g. after a state change), `render()` re-attaches the panel from the latest task data, or closes it if the task disappeared.
- Navigation: card click → `goDetail(id)`; "Edit project" button → `goEdit(id)` (form remembers `detailProjectId` so save returns to detail). Saving a *new* project jumps straight into the detail view so the user can start adding tasks.

## How to Deploy Changes

1. Edit files locally in `e:/Projects/Family Planner/app/`
2. Test at http://localhost:8080 (`python server.py`)
3. For risky changes (refactors, schema-affecting edits), use a feature branch + smoke test before merging to master. Phase 0 followed this pattern; see git log for examples.
4. `git add ...` (specific files, not `-A`), commit, `git push`
5. GitHub Pages rebuilds in ~30 seconds
6. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) on the live site

---

## Conventions

- **No build tools** for the deployed app. ES modules served directly. Playwright is dev-tooling only (gitignored `node_modules/`).
- **Bracket-check JS files** before commit (`node --check <file>` or visual scan).
- **Run `npm run test:e2e` before committing any UI change.** 18 tests, ~80s. If a test fails, fix the code or update the test — do not commit red.
- **Edit specific files, not `-A`** — avoids accidentally committing local-only artefacts.
- **Touch only what the task requires.** Refactors get their own commit/branch.

---

## Outstanding Items (pre-Phase-1 backlog)

These predate the v2.0.0 restructure and are still pending:

1. **Section alignment** — columns don't perfectly align between Income/Outgoings/Split/Residual sections
2. **Planner charges** — expandable charge entries per planner line (like revisions in budget), populating YTD actuals from those charges
3. **CSV parsers** for HSBC, ANZ, Westpac, Bankwest statement formats (NAB only currently)
4. **Bank API** — placeholder exists, no integration yet
5. **GL mappings Firebase sync** — was localStorage-only; check whether Phase-0 ES-module conversion incidentally fixed this (`saveGlMappings` now calls `fbSave`)
6. **Contribution auto-calc** — Brad/Diana Regular marked `autoCalc:true` but not yet recalculated when outgoings change
7. **Mobile polish** — responsive breakpoints exist but could be refined

The much larger v2.0.0 backlog (Projects module: CRUD, views, notifications, AI, celebrations, migration) lives in [tasks/plan.md](../tasks/plan.md) and [tasks/todo.md](../tasks/todo.md).

---

## Where to pick up

- **Active branch:** `family-planner/phase-2-tasks` (Phase 2.1 complete; Phase 1 still unmerged. Phase-2-tasks branched off phase-1-projects-crud, so when phase-2 fast-forwards to master, both are merged together).
- **Last commit:** `76a8678` — Add Playwright smoke-test harness
- **Phase 2 commits on the branch (newest first):**
  - `76a8678` — Add Playwright smoke-test harness (18 E2E tests, Firebase blocked for hermetic runs)
  - `38261be` — Task entity CRUD inside a project (Task 2.1)
- **Phase 1 commits inherited from parent branch (newest first):**
  - `7ad3848` — Handover: Phase 1 wrap-up details
  - `0a50020` — Docs: log Phase 1 in CHANGELOG + update HANDOVER
  - `fd8055d` — Participant management on a project (Task 1.2)
  - `0c93b0f` — Project entity CRUD with tests (Task 1.1)
- **Next task:** Phase 2, Task 2.2 — Subtasks (one level deep, `parentTaskId`) ([plan §2.2](../tasks/plan.md#task-22-subtasks-one-level-deep-parenttaskid))
- **Branch convention:** L/M-sized tasks land on `family-planner/<slug>` feature branches with a smoke test before fast-forward merge to master. XS/S tasks can go direct to master.

### Checkpoint B + 2.1 verification — to run before merging to master

The Playwright suite (`npm run test:e2e`, 18 tests, ~80s) covers all the **functional** acceptance criteria for Phase 1.1, 1.2, and 2.1 plus a Phase 0 module-shell regression check. Firebase is blocked at the network layer in tests so they run hermetically against localStorage.

What the harness **doesn't** cover (and you still need to verify manually on the deployed live site after merge):

1. **Real-Firebase round-trip.** Sign in as Brad, create a project + add a few tasks, hard-refresh: data persists. Open the Firebase console — payload at `household/family/projects` has both `items[]` and `tasks[]` arrays, no orphan tasks.
2. **Two-browser realtime sync.** Browser A signs in as Brad, B as Diana (or two private windows). A creates a project; appears in B within ~2 sec. B adds a task; appears in A. A flips a status to "Done"; B sees the row dim and re-sort.
3. **Visual layout.** Spot-check Projects list, detail view, slide-in panel on desktop. Mobile breakpoint at <600px collapses the task-row grid into stacked rows.
4. **Console check.** Zero red errors on either browser after the above. (Browser-extension `asynchronous response… message channel closed` chatter is not an app issue — ignore it.)

If any of those regress, **do NOT merge** — investigate on the branch.

### Branch cleanup

The phase-1 cleanup routine (`trig_01M8Bsfuv8XL1PgoQsz9EfHr`, fires 2026-05-06) still references `origin/family-planner/phase-1-projects-crud` and will check whether it's been merged into master. After phase-2-tasks fast-forwards to master (which carries phase-1 with it), that routine will succeed and delete the phase-1 origin branch.

A new cleanup routine should be scheduled for `family-planner/phase-2-tasks` after the merge — same pattern: 4–7 days out, check `git merge-base --is-ancestor`, delete on success, nudge on failure. Manage at <https://claude.ai/code/routines/>.

Local branches are yours to delete:
```
git branch -d family-planner/phase-1-projects-crud family-planner/phase-2-tasks
```

### Tests

Two layers of automated tests, run them in this order before any commit:

1. **Pure-data unit tests** (`tests.html`) — fastest signal. Start `python server.py`, open <http://localhost:8080/tests.html>. Imports `js/modules/projects/data.test.js`. ~40 tests covering project + task pure functions (create, validate, list mutators, sanitisers, `completedAt` transitions). All-green expected.
2. **E2E smoke tests** (`npm run test:e2e`) — covers all UI acceptance criteria from Phase 1 + 2.1 plus a module-shell regression check. ~80s, chromium-only, runs against the local dev server (auto-started if not already up). 18 tests; all-green expected.

What the test layers do **not** cover (still manual): real-Firebase round-trip, two-user concurrent editing, visual sanity. Those need real network conditions and human eyes — see "Checkpoint B + 2.1 verification" above.

To add tests for the next phase: append a new `test.describe(...)` block to `tests-e2e/smoke.spec.js`. Use the existing `createProject()` helper at the top of the file. Watch out for `hasText` substring matching colliding with status-dropdown option labels (e.g. a task named "One" matches "Done" — use distinctive names like "Task A", "Task B").

### Quick session onboarding

If you (or another agent) come back to this project cold:

1. Read this file top-to-bottom.
2. `cd app && git status && git log --oneline -10` — confirm what's actually committed.
3. `git branch --show-current` — am I on `master` or the active feature branch?
4. Check [tasks/todo.md](../tasks/todo.md) and [tasks/user-actions.md](../tasks/user-actions.md) for the active checklist and any deferred manual ops.
5. `cd app && npm install` (one-time) → `npm run test:e2e` to sanity-check both data and UI layers are green. Then open <http://localhost:8080/tests.html> for the data-only layer.
6. Then pick up the "Next task" pointer above.
